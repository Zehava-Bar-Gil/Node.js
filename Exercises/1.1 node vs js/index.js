What are 3 things node.js has that the client side javascript doesn’t have:
1. Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags 
   and JS is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.
2. NodeJS code can be run outside the browser and JS can only be run in the browsers.
3. Some of the Nodejs modules are Lodash, express etc. These modules are to be imported from npm
   and Some of the JS frameworks are RamdaJS, TypedJS, etc.
